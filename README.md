## Goal: 
#### The goal of this project is to identify the factors that contribute to the success of a movie, specifically whether the production company, the movie's budget, or other variables play a significant role in determining a movie's success. 
#### By performing a data analysis using Python, this project aims to provide valuable insights that can help movie production companies make more informed decisions about which movies to produce, which companies to partner with, and how to allocate resources to maximize the chances of success.
## Description:
 The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022
 The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information
 The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearsonâ€™s correlation statistical analysis.
## Skills: 
 Data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.
## Technology: 
 Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Datetime, Matplotlib, SciPy.
## Results: 
 Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.
